Overview
--------
The app monitors a driver's pupil movement in order to determine if they are paying attention to the road while driving. The idea is we assumes a correlation between pupil movement with mind functionality. That is if a person isn't paying attention to the road, pupil activity would significantly decrease. Currently the code only works for recognizing pupils from a given video stream. The next updates will include multi-threading in order to improve performance, and the actual pupil monitoring system.
