This application is an end-user implementation of our drowsy driving detection software. Currently it utilizes C++ code to increase processing performance during pupil dectection, and Random Forest for pattern recognition within the data.

The Idea Behind the Code
------------------------
Drowsy driving is a serious problem that caused 3,154 car accidents in 2013. Which is why it has been a well-studied problem with multiple approaches to detect drowsy driving. One approach, hypothesizes that pupil movement differentiates between attentive and drowsy driving.
